# WorkDayScheduler

This is a planner that allows the user to input various events in their schedule for the current day. Those events can be saved and will persist even after the page is refreshed.

The blocks referring to time that has passed will be greyed out, the block of time the user is currently in will be red, and the blocks referring to time that is yet to come will be green.
